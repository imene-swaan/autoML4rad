decision tree models to predict the right hyperparameter values for DEAN anomaly detector trained used number of features and number of samples of 40 training datasets and tuned hyperparameter values (best true params) as target variable.
See main.py for more details on training. 



These decision trees are used in best_params.py to attempt automatic tuning for hyperparameters of test datasets. 
See best_params.py for more details.
